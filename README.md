# CrudDemoAPI

This is a simple CRUD project to solidify my understanding of C# syntax and ASP.NET Core.  
It's a standalone module that I plan to integrate into a more complex project in the future.  

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, Delete Customers and Products
- Async database operations with EF Core
- Basic HTTP responses and status codes
- Data validation with DTOs
- Object mapping using AutoMapper for clean separation between entities and API responses
